# NArchitecture.Core.Persistence.DependencyInjection

This library provides dependency injection extensions for persistence utilities in kodlama.io projects. The `NArchitecture.Core.Persistence.DependencyInjection` package offers utilities to configure and use persistence services within the dependency injection framework effectively. It includes core classes and extensions for integrating data access and persistence services into the dependency injection container in both clean and union architectures, supporting the configuration and registration of repositories, unit of work pattern, and essential utilities for data access and persistence dependency injection across various data storage technologies such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, and file systems.
